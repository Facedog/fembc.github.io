To kick off the series, we'll be discusssing the what the word "feminism" means, why it's often a loaded word, and why our generation has struggled to define the term for ourselves.

####Discussion Topics

* What is your personal definition of feminism?
* Do you (or do you not) identify as a feminist?
* Why do you think so many young women (including many [female celebrities](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a28510/misconceptions-about-feminism/)) are rejecting the term?

>Currently, only 24% of women in the United States say that they consier themseles feminists, yet when offered a more specific definition of feminism-"A feminist is someone who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes"-the percentage of women who agree rises to 65%.- **Sheryl Sandberg, Lean In:  Women, Work, and the Will to Lead**
