####Discussion Topics
* As women, we typically outperform men in terms of emotional intelligence and communication skills. How can we leverage that in the corporate sphere?
* Women make up the majority of college graduates and data proves companies with female leaders report higher earnings. So why do men still hold the majority of leadership and executive positions?
* Women are greatly underrepresented in scientific and mathematical fields. Why is that? What can we do to change that?
* Do we as women view "success" differently from men? How does having a family affect a woman's career vs a man's?
