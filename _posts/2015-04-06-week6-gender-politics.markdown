####Discussion Topics
* Many believe that men and women think, interpret, and communicate differently. Do you think that's true? If so, is it a product of biology or environment? Or both?
* The ultimate goal of feminism is to grant equal rights and opportunities to men and women. Does that mean that men and women are equally qualified for all positions and industries? 
* We're all aware of the many gender stereotypes out there, with some being offensive and just plain false. Some, however, have the potential to be empowering. Do you celebrate and/or leverage those in your professional and personal lives?
