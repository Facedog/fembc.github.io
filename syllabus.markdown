##Week 1: Definition of Feminism 

###Date: Mon Feb 23
To kick off the series, we'll be discusssing the what the word "feminism" means, why it's often a loaded word, and why our generation has struggled to define the term for ourselves.

####Discussion Topics

* What is your personal definition of feminism?
* Do you (or do you not) identify as a feminist?
* Why do you think so young women (including many [female celebrities](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/news/a28510/misconceptions-about-feminism/)) are rejecting the term?
